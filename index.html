      <h1>My Top Three Most Developed Skills (and Three Fun Facts)</h1>
      <h2>1. Web Development</h2>
        <p>Eat. Sleep. Code. Repeat. As a full-time Lambda School student, this is my life. I code for 8-10 hours everyday. Imagine how much experience will accumulate in a year. So, why coding? I foresee a future where robots will replace human workers. Instead of resisting that reality (which would be futile), I'm learning to communicate with the scary machines.</p>
      <h2>2. Content Marketing</h2>
        <p>A tricky thing about writing online = many people want you to produce content that gets published in <em>their</em> name. Thus, I can't reveal the identity of past clients. But I <strong>can</strong> tell you they've been featured in major news and talk shows such as Today, 20/20, Inside Edition. Also: I've written as more women than men (and no one seemed to notice).</p>
      <h2>3. Social Media Management</h2>
        <p>Since last September, I've walked 50+ shelter dogs. I also created Facebook posts about the animals and shared them on the shelter's page. Result: 75% of those dogs have a home. I've also managed FB pages for businesses and entrepreneurs, but that doesn't make me feel nearly as proud as the previous factoid. </p>
