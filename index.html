      <h1>My Top Three Most Developed Skills (and Three Fun Facts)</h1>
      <h2>1. Web Development</h2>
        <p>Eat. Sleep. Code. Repeat. As a full-time Lambda School student, this is my life. I code for 8-10 hours everyday. Imagine how much experience will accumulate in a year. So, why coding? I foresee a future where robots will replace human workers. Instead of resisting that reality (which would be futile), I'm learning to communicate with the scary machines.</p>
      <h2>2. Content Marketing</h2>
        <p>A tricky thing about writing online = many people want you to produce content that gets published in <em>their</em> name. Thus, I can't reveal the identity of past clients. But I <strong>can</strong> tell you they've been featured in major news and talk shows such as Today, 20/20, and Inside Edition. Also: I've written as more women than men (and no one seemed to notice).</p>
      <h2>3. Social Media Management</h2>
        <p>Since last September, I've walked 50+ shelter dogs. I also created Facebook posts about the animals and shared them on the shelter's page. Result: 75% of those dogs have a home. I've also managed FB pages for businesses and entrepreneurs, but that doesn't make me feel nearly as proud as the previous factoid. </p>

      <h1>Work History (and Reasons You Desperately Need Me)</h1> 
      <h2>1. Financial Services Representative (Appalachian Community Federal Credit Union)</h2>
      <p>My #1 responsibility = keeping members with large investment accounts happy. The CEO trusted me to make deals with these members to keep their money locked in. Often, I rewarded them with a slight increase in the deposit rate for expanding their relationship with the credit union. For example: actions such as opening a credit card, setting up a direct deposit, and signing up for online banking. This job taught me how to negotiate effectively.</p>
      <h2>2. Office Manager (Bristol Family YMCA)</h2>
      <p>As a liftaholic, I enjoyed combining my interests in fitness and business. The fitness staff often picked my brain for marketing ideas. I also provided new members with tours of the facility and orientations in which I taught them how to use the equipment. My goal was to make a positive first impression so they felt welcome. This position showed me how to teach people below my skill level.</p>
      <h2>3. Freelance Writer (Many Different Clients, Most of Whom May Not Be Named)</h2>
      <p>I've written content for several different industries including: automotive, fitness, online marketing, and self-help/personal development. My articles have been read by millions and shared more than 200,000 times. Feel free to browse my archives at <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/author/daniel-wallen-2" target="_blank">Lifehack</a> and <a href="https://pakwired.com/author/daniel/" target="_blank">Pakwired</a>, as that's where most of the content written in my name lives. These opportunities sharpened my ability to communicate.</p>
      <h2>4. Waiter (Piccadilly Cafeteria)</h2>
      <p>I'm aware this might seem out of place. Even so, I loved it. Why? It was an active and engaging job where I met people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Also, one of my biggest mantras is, "The way you do one thing is the way you do everything." If I can't clean a restaurant according to a manager's expectations, then how in the heck would I write code that meets your specifications? </p>
